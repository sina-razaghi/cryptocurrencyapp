# Digit_CU Cryptocurrency App 


Digit_CU is an application that aims to display the updated price of digital currencies and their details along with their virtual buying and selling to record profits and losses with features such as news, feedback, online support, etc.

Information is received online from the coinmarcet site API for the main page and from the nobitex site for the current price of Rials and Dollars. All APIs used are free.

API is implemented with asp.net core 3.1 and database with sql server 2018. I used the repository architecture for the API.
